**1. Blogs (Digital Copywriting)**

I have written various Blogs on the BikeChuno Website, a Project on which I worked during my internship.

I wrote the blogs on various topics such as Comparison between the vehicles, Top vehicles in a particular segment, Vehciles to buy under a particular segment, Information on newly launched vehicles etc and so on..

**2. Banner Images and Short Videos**

I created 50+ Banner Images using different tools and features in Canva.
I used these images further for the Blogs that I wrote.

**3. Optimised Website Content**

Keyword Research: 

I conducted thorough keyword research using the tools like Google Keyword Planner and SEMrush to identify relevant keywords which most users are searching and further used all those keywords in my content, ensuring high-quality, informative content to match user search intent and eventually attracting more targeted traffic to the website.

On-Page SEO: 

I worked on adding the Meta titles, Descriptions, Headers, Internal links, Image alt texts, Call-to-Action prompt with the targeted keywords to improve the websiteâ€™s Search engine visibility and to increase the website ranking on a particular search query related to my website's content.

Page Load Speed Optimization: 

I analysed the website loading speed by using online tools and then worked on optimising the loading speed by compressing images, using browser caching, and minimizing CSS, JavaScript, and HTML code to increase the website performance.

Google Analytics Integration: 

I also linked Google Analytics with the website and regularly monitored user behaviour, source of traffic and the conversion rates.
