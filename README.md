# Digital_Marketing_Projects

**1. Blogs (Digital Copywriting)**

I have written various Blogs on the BikeChuno Website, a Project on which I worked during my internship.

I wrote the blogs on various topics such as Comparison between the vehicles, Top vehicles in a particular segment, Vehciles to buy under a particular segment, Information on newly launched vehicles etc and so on..

**2. Banner Images and Short Videos**

I created 50+ Banner Images using different tools and features in Canva.
I used these images further for the Blogs that I wrote.

I also created multiple Short Videos using Canva. 
I further uploaded these videos on Youtube shorts.
